README

glScript is a script driven OpenGL toolkit. It is a tool that lets you run OpenGL
programs written in existing scripting languages like JavaScript, VB Script and 
view its output. It also provides support for creating and integrating your own
libraries for graphics programming and animation. You can either use OpenGL APIs
directly from your script or use library APIs for rendering graphics and 
animation. glScript can be used for 2D/3D graphics applications based on OpenGL. 
It is a useful tool for anyone interested in 3D graphics programming, OpenGL in 
particular. It can also be useful for advanced OpenGL programmers for testing their
code without any need to write a compiled OpenGL program in C/C++.

With glScript, there are no headers to include, no libraries to link, just script 
and go :-)

glScript is currently available only for Windows platforms. Support for other 
platforms can be added in the near feature.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
\bin:	
	bin is a container folder that replicates the actual installation folder.
	By default, it contains samples, textures, models and script include files
	in their respective subfolders. extensions folder is empty initially.
	When you build 'glsrun' it is placed under this folder (bin). Packaging
	scripts placed under \setup folder also builds the installer from this 
	folder.

\builds:
	Contains projects to build various components like static libraries, 
	extensions and frontend tools.

\docs:	
	Contains documentation for the glscript project and SDK. Also contains
	README and RELEASE-NOTES provided with the installer.

\include:
	Contains C/C++ include headers required to build glscript.

\src:	
	Contains C/C++ source files required to build glscript.

\setup:
	Contains NSIS scripts for creating installers.

\packages:
	Output folder for installer / distribution packages.

\screenshots:
	Screenshots of glscript GUI tool (glsrun).

NOTES ON HOW TO BUILD:

Requirements:
- You will require Visual Studio 2010 or later to build glScript.

i. Go to \builds\glscript folder and open glscript.sln. Select build configuration
   (DEBUG/RELEASE). Build the project. This will create glscript.lib and glscript.tlb 
   under \lib folder.

ii. Go to \builds\glsrun folder and open glsrun.sln. Select build configuration
    same as glscript.sln. Build the project. This will create glsrun.exe under
    \bin directory.

To build extensions (optional, required for some sample programs):

iii. Go to \builds\ folder. Open folder for the extension you wish to build.
    For example to build 'glu' extension open gls_glu folder. Open the solution
    file (for example, gls_glu.sln). Select the build configuration same as used
    for glscript.sln. Build the project. This will create the extension dll under
    \bin\extensions (for example, \bin\extensions\gls_glu.dll).
    Similarly, you can build other extensions too.

NOTES ON HOW TO BUILD SETUP / INSTALLER:

Requirements:
- You will require NSIS (Nullsoft Sriptable Install System) 2.46 or above to build
  the glScript setup / installer program.

- You will also require "AppAssocReg" plugin if you want to build the latest version
  of the installer. You can download this plugin from the Internet and register on 
  your system before running the setup script.

i. Build all components by following steps in listed under NOTES ON HOW TO BUILD
   section.

ii. Go to \setup\ folder. Select the latest setup script for e.g. glscript-0.8-beta.nsi,
    to build the installer for version 0.8 beta release. Right click on the icon, and
    select Compile NSIS script. If everything compiles successfully, it will generate 
    the installer under \packages\ directory, for e.g. glscript-0.8-beta-release.exe if
    you compile glscript-0.8-beta.nsi script.
